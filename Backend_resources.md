# Backend Development Resources
This file contains a comprehensive list of resources that can be valuable for backend development in the SnapScribe project. These resources cover various aspects such as backend frameworks and API development.

Backend Frameworks
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) - A lightweight and versatile Python web framework. Flask provides a simple yet powerful foundation for building web applications and APIs.

[Django]() - A high-level Python web framework known for its "batteries included" approach. It offers robust features for building scalable and secure web applications.

The preferred method for this project is a Flask web server serving the ML model, but you can use Django if you're more comfortable with that. The high level concept remains the same with any of the two, which is that you will have to build routes in the web app to serve predictions.
