# SnapScribe
SnapScribe is a cutting-edge image captioning web app powered by the perfect blend of modern technologies. With a sleek and responsive user interface built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, SnapScribe offers a seamless and visually appealing experience for users. 

Behind the scenes, Flask serves as the robust backend, seamlessly integrating with the ML models responsible for generating captivating captions. Hosted within Flask, these AI models utilize state-of-the-art techniques in sequence modelling and computer vision to provide accurate and contextually relevant captions for your images. With SnapScribe, you can effortlessly enhance the storytelling potential of your images, bridging the gap between visuals and engaging narratives.

# Roadmap for SnapScribe
## 1. Building the ML Model in a Python Notebook

- Set up a Python development environment with the necessary libraries, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Develop and train the image captioning model using state-of-the-art techniques in sequence modeling and computer vision (Resources and examples will be provided)
- Use suitable datasets for training and evaluation, ensuring the model can generate accurate and contextually relevant captions

## 2. Backend Route Creation and Hosting the Model

- Set up a Flask backend to handle HTTP requests and responses
- Create routes for handling image uploads and caption generation
- Integrate the trained ML model into the Flask backend, allowing it to generate captions for uploaded images
- Test the backend routes locally to ensure they are functioning correctly

## 3. Frontend Development

- Set up the frontend development environment with React.js and Tailwind CSS
- Design and create the user interface, including components for image uploading and caption display
- Implement the necessary functionality for uploading images to the backend API and displaying the generated captions
- Ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend components
- Website should be styled well using Tailwind CSS

## 4. Testing and Bug Fixes

- Perform thorough testing of the application's functionality, including the ML model integration, backend routes, and frontend interactions
- Identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing
- Conduct user acceptance testing to ensure the application meets the desired requirements and provides a satisfactory user experience

## 5. Deployment and Hosting

- Choose a suitable hosting platform, such as Github Pages, Netlify to deploy the web app
- Configure the deployment environment and ensure proper functioning in the live environment
- Host the ML model on something like `pythonanywhere.com`

## 6. Documentation and Maintenance

- Create comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and API documentation
- Maintain the project by addressing bug reports, feature requests, and potential enhancements
- Continuously update and improve the application, incorporating user feedback and new technologies as appropriate
